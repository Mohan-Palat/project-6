## Approach taken, Planning, Notes and Wireframe

- Started out by planning and making a wireframe
![Wireframe](public/img/wireframe.png) 
- Began with getting the 7 RESTful routes working and full CRUD 
- Used the Model, Views, Controllers structure (MVC)
- KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
